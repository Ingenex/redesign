If the backup does not proceed within 15 seconds then something is interfering with the WordPress CRON system such as: server loopback issues, caching plugins, or scheduling plugins. Try disabling other plugins to see if it resolves issue.  Check the Server Information page cron section to see if the next BackupBuddy step is scheduled to run. Enable \"Classic\" backup mode on the \"Settings\" page to rule out non-cron issues."}
